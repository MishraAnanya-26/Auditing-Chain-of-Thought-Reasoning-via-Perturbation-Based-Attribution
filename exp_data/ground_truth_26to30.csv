"Let's denote Darrell's age as D and Allen's age as A. We know that the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which means D/A = 7/11.","['Darrell', 'Allen's ages are in the', 'ratio of 7:11']",30
"We also know that their total age is 162, so D + A = 162.","['If their total age now', 'is 162', 'calculate Allen's age 10 years']",30
"First, let's express D in terms of A from the ratio equation: D = 7A/11.","['ratio of 7:11', 'If their total age now', 'is 162']",30
"Now, substitute D in the total age equation: 7A/11 + A = 162.","['If their total age now', 'is 162', 'calculate Allen's age 10 years']",30
