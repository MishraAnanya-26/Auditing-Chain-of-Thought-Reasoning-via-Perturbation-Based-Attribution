"Let's denote the age of Raymond's son as R and the age of Samantha as S. We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so we can write the equation:","['Raymond was born 6 years', 'before Samantha', 'If Samantha is now 31']",21
R = S - 6,"['Raymond was born 6 years', 'before Samantha', 'If Samantha is now 31']",21
"We also know that Raymond's son is now 23 years old, so we can write the equation:","['Raymond had a son at', 'the age of 23', 'Raymond's son born']",21
R = 23,"['Raymond had a son at', 'the age of 23', 'Raymond's son born']",21
"Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Since both equations equal R, we can set them equal to each other:","['Raymond was born 6 years', 'before Samantha', 'the age of 23']",21
S - 6 = 23,"['Raymond was born 6 years', 'before Samantha', 'the age of 23']",21
Now we can solve for S:,"['If Samantha is now 31', 'how many years ago was', 'Raymond's son born']",21
S = 23 + 6,"['If Samantha is now 31', 'how many years ago was', 'Raymond's son born']",21
S = 29,"['If Samantha is now 31', 'how many years ago was', 'Raymond's son born']",21
